Much of that change is being driven by huge technological strides that have been appearing since the start of the 21st century. However, for the average designer in the architectural services industry, it’s still 1999.

Here at Nimble, we’d like to change that.

We’re focused on the pre-construction side of the building process, striving to make it easier for designers to reap the benefits that technology has to offer. Our products make it easier to use BIM tools, decreasing the time it takes you to get from an idea to finished product.

How do we do that? 

We augment the way that a user experiences an application like Revit, giving more understandable warnings and smoothing out some of the things that make working in the program less intuitive. 

Most importantly, we like to produce elegant and meaningful interfaces for the user to connect to - and hopefully - a visually beautiful product. From AI and machine learning to predictive analysis we’re integrating the latest technologies into the design process, making it easier to build better, faster and smarter.
