  The world is changing fast - very fast.

  Much of that change is being driven by huge strides in technology that have been appearing since the start of the 21st century. However, for many in the architectural services industry, we‘ve found that much of that progress hasn’t made its way over. Sure, we’ve got drones and laser scanning on the Construction Side, along with some Virtual/Augmented Reality tech but for the average designer, it’s still 1999.

  Here at Nimble, we’d like to change that.

  We’re focused on the preconstruction side of the building process, striving to make it easier for designers to reap the benefits of all this new technology has to offer. Our products are designed to make it easier to use BIM tools to make better buildings.

  How do we do that? 

  Well, to us, design works best when it’s simple and accessible to all so we’re dedicated to creating products that decrease the pain of getting you from idea to built object. We augment the way that a user experiences an application like Revit, giving more understandable warnings and smoothing out some of the things that make working in the program less intuitive. Most importantly, we like to produce elegant and meaningful interfaces for the user to connect to - and hopefully - a visually beautiful product. From AI and Machine Learning to Predictive Analysis we’re integrating the latest technologies into the design process, making it easier to build better, faster and smarter.

  Welcome to the future - we’ve been waiting for you.
